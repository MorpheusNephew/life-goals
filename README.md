## Purpose

The purpose of working on this app is to work on some skills that I might not have used in a while and to sharpen the ones that I currently have

## Tech used

This will continue to be updated as I continue to work on it, but the current tech/frameworks/etc... used are as follows

- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) to handle all things auth related
- Web uses [React](https://react.dev/) with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
- API uses [Express](https://expressjs.com/) with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [ChatGPT](https://platform.openai.com/) to generate the "Advice" for the Life Goals
- For local development I'm using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) via [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo) for data storage
- When deployed the app will use [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) (when I add unit tests)
